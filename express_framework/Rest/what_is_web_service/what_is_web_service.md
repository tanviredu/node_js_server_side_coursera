what is web service ??
web service is a system that is designed to support interoperatability of systems connected pver a network

we use a service oriented architecture(SOA)

we cann connect different web based application with different standerd operating over the internet


there are two common approach

SOAP (Simple Object Access protocols )  C# uses it

API stands for Application Programming environment

SOAP and REST both allow you to create your own API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
########################
It makes it possible to transfer data from an application to other applications.
########################
 SOAP is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP and SMTP

and it uses the XML to send the data from application to application

SOAP has standerd rule cause its a protocol



On the other hand REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

you can not use soap insted of rest but you can use the Rest insted of soap

because soap is a protocol and Rest is a concept

it has multiple standerd like HTTP,mostly JSON,XML etc

it is must simpler 





just remember SOAP is XML 

rest use the JSON

client server comminucation is used REST API
