what is sessions
    
    there is  a problem in the cookies is that cookies cant store a lot of information
    it just gives you the information about who is the user
    to track information in the server side you need to use the session
    with session you can store information in database or any filesystem
        now session is a combination of the cookie itself and a session id
        with other information

        you can use any parmanent storage to store the databse
        like mysql or mongodb itself
         a session has these following things
         
         -> cookies
         -> session id which is actualy the uuid
         -> name of the session id
         -> proxy
         -> resave option if the cookies is modified
         -> secret key
         -> store type and storage size
         -> unset option
