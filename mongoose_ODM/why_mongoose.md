#why mongoose
### when we use the mongodb driver
### we do not use any schema for the 
### database and we just post it
### update delete and read the database
### if we use mongoose we can provide 
### a database schema like  a sql database and then apply CRUD

thats why it calles ODM

-Object Data Model
or
Object Document Mapping
or
Object Relational Mapping

With Sql we have to make a Strict Relational mapping and you cant upload any data which is not on the structure in sql database
but in Nosql you can upload data that has no realtion with the structure
but to make a app we still need some kind of schema and relation thats why we use the mongoose
