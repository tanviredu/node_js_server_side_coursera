body parser iused to extract the information
its a middleware
and it parse data in json format

client either upload data in the server
ot download data from the server
in a rest api based server

express router is used to make a URI for diffeent endpoint
it will apply http verb to do that action

Express supports different methods for the constructing a rest api server

different different route in the express route have a different different function
that does different different operation in rest api
its like the urls.py in python django or laravel router



body parser enables us to parse the information from the pages
if the body contain differen different format



body parser change the "req.body" in the program 
so whatever it parses it will be in the req.body


if it has multiple end point then use the different route
for different different endpoint
